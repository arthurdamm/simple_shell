# simple shell
### Overview
`simple shell` is UNIX command interpreter that replicates core functionalities of the sh shell. This project was developed as part of the third month curriculum at [Holberton School](https://www.\holbertonschool.com/), San Francisco.
### Installation
Clone this repository into your local system and compile using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`.
### Usage
* Once in the shell, use exactly like sh. A list of covered features is provided below. The shell can run in either interactive or non-interactive mode.
* Function returns with the specified exit status.

### Features
The shell handles command line input, including arguements, without the use of most standard library functions such as `printf` or `getline`. In addition to running executables in the PATH, the following features are currently implemented.

|  Builtin Commands  |    Functionality                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `exit [status]`    | Exit shell with specified exit status       |
| `env`              | Print list of current environment variables |
| `setenv`           | Set an environment variable                 |
| `unsetenv`         | Unset an environment variable               |
| `cd`               | Change directories                          |

|  Other Features    |    Functionality                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-D`           | End of file - exit shell                    |
| `Ctrl-C`           | Does not exit shell - (Differs from `sh`)   |
| `;`                | Command separator, allows command chaining  |
| '#'                | Comment indicator                           |

### Example Usage
* This shell takes input the same as a standard unix shell.  After running the executable `hsh`, enter desired input and press return.
* `ls -l`
* `exit 98`
* `cd -`
### Release History
